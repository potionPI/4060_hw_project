# ECBM E4060 Project

This is the GitHub submission for the ECBM E4060 class project.

Kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/overview

## Explanation of the files:

These files are Kaggle notebooks in order. The code is heavily pieced together from different publicly available Kaggle notebooks and put in order. Credit is given in each of the notebooks:
- nb1-basic-intro-to-the-data.ipynb ) This is the jupyter notebook run on Kaggle which does some basic data exploration
- nb1-1-multiome-to-sparse-matrices.ipynb ) This is the jupyter notebook run on Kaggle which converts a dataset to sparse matrix format
- nb2-multiome.ipynb ) This is the jupyter notebook which creates and runs the model for the multiome data
- nb3-citeseq.ipynb ) This is the jupyter notebook which creates and runs the model for the CITEseq data

This notebook is not run on Kaggle, but rather Google Colab:
- Significance_checks.ipynb ) This jupyter notebook performs some statistical tests on data concerning feature reduction, model performance, and explained variance
